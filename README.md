### Hi I'm Kay Kim ðŸ‘‹

I work for samsung electronics as a software developer. My main role in my work could be explained by two position.
First of all, I'm a NAND Flash software developer such as Flash Interface Layer firmware code by using C++ or C language.


And I'm a Strategy Semiconductor Researcher so I made Tech-News-Briefing every week, Leader's book review and Gartner Curation every month.
Tech News Briefing : 
Leader's book review :
Gartner Curation : 

Lastly, I was a Software Maestro 10th member (The government-sponsored project designed to discover the best SW talent)
