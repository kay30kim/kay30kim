## MyOwnLibrary: A Comprehensive Implementation of String and List Functions with Dynamic Memory Allocation
### Project Overview
MyOwnLibrary is the product of my relentless pursuit of a deeper understanding of C/C++ programming. It serves as a testament to my dedication to this craft. This library not only replicates all the essential functions found in **<stdio.h>** and **<stdlib.h>** but also takes a step further by implementing a wide array of string and list-related functions. Moreover, it places a strong emphasis on the judicious management of memory allocation, ensuring that efficiency and stability are upheld throughout all operations.

## Implementation of printf: Mastery of Variable Arguments and Function Parameters
### Project Overview
As I continued my journey in C/C++ programming, I embarked on a mission that demanded a profound understanding of variable-argument functions. I decided to recreate the iconic **printf** function entirely from scratch. This endeavor proved to be pivotal in helping me grasp the intricacies of variable functions and parameters. It was a challenging but immensely rewarding experience, and it significantly enriched my expertise in the realm of programming.

## Implementation of get_next_line: Enhancing Proficiency in Static Variables and Functions
### Project Overview
The implementation of `get_next_line` was a project that made a significant impact on my programming proficiency. This project has greatly enhanced my understanding of static variables and functions, emphasizing their importance in managing and maintaining the state across multiple function calls. Beyond this, it has provided valuable insights into the intricacies of file handling and data manipulation. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the reading of content line by line from file descriptors.


#### ðŸ”­ < Now > 
I work for samsung electronics as a software developer. My main role in my work could be explained by two position.

First of all, I'm a NAND Flash software developer such as Flash Interface Layer firmware code by using C++ or C language.

Secondly, I'm a Strategy Semiconductor Researcher so I made Tech-News-Briefing every week, Leader's book review and Gartner Curation every month. I strongly believe that all my lessons learned from this work has go to be valuable source for me and my company.

#### ðŸ”­ < Past >
I was a Software Maestro 10th member (The government-sponsored project designed to discover the best SW talent)
