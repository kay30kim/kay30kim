### Hi I'm Kay Kim ðŸ‘‹
### Project Description
#### MyOwnLibrary: A Comprehensive Implementation of String and List Functions with Dynamic Memory Allocation
* In my pursuit of a deeper understanding of C/C++ programming, I have meticulously crafted MyOwnLibrary. This library not only replicates all the essential functions found in **<stdio.h> **and **<stdlib.h> **but also goes the extra mile in implementing string and list-related functions while judiciously managing memory allocation.

### Implementation of printf: Mastery of Variable Arguments and Function Parameters

In my relentless pursuit of C/C++ programming mastery, I delved deep into the world of variable-argument functions. I embarked on the challenging journey of recreating the iconic** printf **function from scratch. This endeavor was pivotal in helping me comprehend the intricate workings of variable functions and parameters.

#### ðŸ”­ < Now > 
I work for samsung electronics as a software developer. My main role in my work could be explained by two position.

First of all, I'm a NAND Flash software developer such as Flash Interface Layer firmware code by using C++ or C language.

Secondly, I'm a Strategy Semiconductor Researcher so I made Tech-News-Briefing every week, Leader's book review and Gartner Curation every month. I strongly believe that all my lessons learned from this work has go to be valuable source for me and my company.

#### ðŸ”­ < Past >
I was a Software Maestro 10th member (The government-sponsored project designed to discover the best SW talent)
